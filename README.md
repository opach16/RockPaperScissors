# Rock-Paper-Scissors

RockPaperScissors is an extended version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.  
In this version, there are five possible moves instead of three: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, and Lizard.  
Each move can defeat two other moves, and is defeated by two others.  
The player competes against the computer in multiple rounds to see who can reach the set number of winning rounds first.


**Game Rules**:

- Rock crushes Scissors and crushes Lizard.
- Paper covers Rock and disproves Spock.
- Scissors cuts Paper and decapitates Lizard.
- Spock smashes Scissors and vaporizes Rock.
- Lizard eats Paper and poisons Spock.

**How to Play**:

1. Enter your name.
2. Decide the number of winning rounds required to end the game (1-10). 
3. Choose Your Move (1-5).


Number of winning rounds:
This is the number of rounds a player or the computer must win to be declared the overall winner.

Move:
For each round, both the player and the computer will choose one of the five moves (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock).

Determine the Winner of the Round:
Compare the player's move with the computer's move according to the rules.
The winner of the round gains one point.

End the Game:
The game continues with each new round until either the player or the computer reaches the set number of winning rounds.
Once a player reaches the defined maximum winning rounds, the game ends and prints the result, showing the final scores and the overall winner.
